# What is here

This repo contains my config files for my work environment.
It contains configuration files for:
- (Neo)Vim, Ideavim and VsCode
- Bash and Zsh
- Git
- Terminal emulator: WezTerm, Alacritty and Windows Terminal

In addition, there are several small installation and setup scripts.
For management of my setup, I use a [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just).
`just --list` will print list of all utilities.
